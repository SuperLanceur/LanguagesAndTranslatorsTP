If you want to recompile graphs, use the bash file "compile_graph.sh"
```bash
./compile_graph.sh TPx filename
```
where filename is the name of the exercice without the .tex extension, this will save the new graph to the img/TPx folder

Recompile the main file with
```bash
./compile.sh
```
This will recompile the main.pdf file

You have to install :
```
sudo apt install texlive-latex-base

```
sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra
```
